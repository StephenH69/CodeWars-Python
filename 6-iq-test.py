# IQ Test
# Bob is preparing to pass IQ test.
# The most frequent task in this test is to find out which 
# one of the given numbers differs from the others. 
# Bob observed that one number usually differs from the others in evenness. 
# Help Bob â€” to check his answers, he needs a program that among 
# the given numbers finds one that is different in evenness, and return a 
# position of this number.

# iq_test("2 4 7 8 10") => 3 // 
# Third number is odd, while the rest of the numbers are even

# iq_test("1 2 1 1") => 2 // 
# Second number is even, while the rest of the numbers are odd
