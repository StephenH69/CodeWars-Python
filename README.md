# CodeWars Python

These are my completed CodeWars.com python challenges.

I usually add details of the challenge as notes in the files, so some of the files have these notes, but others don't.

Once I have completed the challenge I review other peoples solutions and add them in as an alternative function in my file, I find this is a good way for me to learn alternative methods.
