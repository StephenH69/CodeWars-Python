# John wants to decorate a room with wallpaper. He's heard that 
# making sure he has the right amount of wallpaper is more complex 
# than it sounds. He wants a fool-proof method for getting it right.

# John knows that the rectangular room has a length of l meters, a
# width of w meters, a height of h meters. The standard width of 
# the rolls he wants to buy is 52 centimeters. The length of a roll 
# is 10 meters. He bears in mind however, that itâ€™s best to have an 
# extra length of wallpaper handy in case of mistakes or miscalculations 
# so he wants to buy a length 15% greater than the one he needs.

# Last time he did these calculations he got a headache, so could 
# you help John? Your function wallpaper(l, w, h) should return as a 
# plain English word in lower case the number of rolls he must buy.

# Example:
# wallpaper(4.0, 3.5, 3.0) should return "ten"
# wallpaper(0.0, 3.5, 3.0) should return "zero"

# Notes:
# all rolls (even with incomplete width) are put edge to edge
# 0 <= l, w, h (floating numbers), it can happens that w x h x l is zero
# the integer r (number of rolls) will always be less or equal to 20
# FORTH: the number of rolls will be a positive or null integer 
# (not a plain English word; this number can be greater than 20)
